		Here’s a thought experiment. If you were to choose between two futures, one where
		laptops/computers become obsolete and only smartphones exist or the opposite, one where
		smartphones become obsolete and laptops/computers become obsolete,
		which future would you lean towards because I know for sure where I’m headed.<br><br>
		I'll make the case for both starting with a future consisting solely of smartphones. Smartphones
		have come a long way, from the early Android days to the Blackberry era to the revolutionary
		iPhone, the introduction of phablets and today where phablets are now a norm. Even in terms of
		computing power, phones have become so powerful that they’re even comparable with some laptops.
		What Apple is doing with their bionic chips is particularly impressive. For reference Apple’s
		A12X Bionic chip was able to outdo an Intel i7 chip by a sizeable margin.<br><br>
	</p>
	<div class="two-grid">
		<div class="grid-item">
			<img src="../assets/blog-images/a12x.png" class="grid-image" alt="a12x">
			<p>A12X</p>
		</div>
		<div class="grid-item">
			<img src="../assets/blog-images/i7.png" class="grid-image" alt="i7">
			<p>i7</p>
		</div>
	</div>


	<p>
		Of course, for peak performance no phone will outperform a highly specced PC because of form
		factor, heat and such but for most tasks, we can see that phones are now more than powerful
		enough, especially given that the A12X is now more than a year old. Phones also have the
		advantage of being extremely portable, extremely light and extremely easy to use. It goes
		without saying that desktop operating systems are way more complicated than smartphone
		operating systems. I mean, Windows 10 has the system settings, Control Panel, the registry
		editor and the Command Prompt whereas Android just has one settings page<br><br>
		One area where I for sure would suffer, is the typing experience. Especially for me, a
		programmer, whose job is to sit and type words into a computer. Having that now on a
		comparatively tiny phone screen would be a huge inconvenience. Touch keyboards will just never
		feel as good as clacking away at a physical keyboard even with the best haptics in the world.
		With that said, here’s a bold statement: there’s nothing you can do on your phone that you can’t
		do on a laptop, but the opposite isn’t true. <br><br>
		Laptops too have evolved over the years and nowadays you can find an LTE, 4K OLED touchscreen,
		2-in-1, stylus-supported laptop that flies. Okay maybe not that last part but the point is
		laptops are very versatile and for whatever use case you have, there’s likely a laptop for you.
		Even though desktop operating systems are more complicated, they’re at the same time more
		capable and productivity focused than their mobile counterparts. The best thing is that that
		doesn’t introduce any caveats for when you wanna kick back and relax. They’re arguably better at
		that as well because Netflix will look much better on a big screen than it will on a phone
		screen. Games will run much better on the beefier hardware and creatives will have a much more
		immersive experience on the higher quality screens.<br><br>
		It’ll still be awkward trying to take a group selfie on a laptop or putting a laptop to your ear
		to take a “phone” call but the fact remains, it’s possible. You’d have a really hard time
		running Photoshop or typing a thesis on a phone. Granted, in a future with only smartphones,
		these would be optimised for the mobile experience. But do you really wanna type a 5000 word
		essay on a phone? Because I for one don’t.
	</p>

		Which future would you prefer? Don’t be swayed by my bulletproof water tight argument, I wanna
		hear your thoughts. Do you agree with my bold statement? If you were wondering about tablets,
		they’re obsolete too. Same goes for foldables. I’ll see you in the comments.<br><br>

		content: `<p style="font-size: 1rem;">
		I had a shower thought, about taking a shower. The thought intrigued me and I haven't stopped
		thinking about it. It intrigued me so much that I couldn’t keep it to myself any longer, so I’ve
		come to share it with you. I think I’ll make this a series, so with that said, welcome to the
		pilot of <i>Shower Thoughts</i>.<br><br>
		One of the key parts about taking a shower is spending five minutes balancing the flow of the
		cold and hot water to get the temperature just right. This act of making minor adjustments to
		the cold and hot water taps (or lever) is what my thought is based on.<br><br>
		If you’ve ever showered later than everyone else, (or if that’s just your routine like me)
		you’ll know about the struggle of there no longer being any hot water when you get around to it.
		Another version of the struggle is when there still is some hot water, but you can feel it
		finishing as you shower, which is much worse in my opinion. The latter version is what got me
		thinking.<br><br>
		I thought, I can feel this water losing its heat because it’s happening at a relatively fast
		rate. What if it were to happen at a slower rate though? A much much slower rate. Would I still
		be able to tell that the temperature is changing, or would my body not be sensitive enough to
		sense it and I end up showering with substantially cooler water? My initial thought was that
		there must be some threshold at which a trigger in my body goes off, maybe when I start getting
		goosebumps but I don’t really have an understanding of how the body deals with changes in
		temperatures to know.<br><br>
		In the same breath, I also thought about the temperature going the other way. If the temperature
		were to be raised at a very gradual rate, would I be able to tell that this water is getting
		hotter? And instead of goosebumps the sensation of getting burnt. In this version, you might
		actually be more likely to pick up the difference because although a cold shower is definitely a
		thing, the human won’t be able to tolerate a shower that’s too hot.<br><br>
		My guess is that at a gradual enough rate, you likely won’t be able to tell that the temperature
		is changing, given that you don’t know that that’s what’s happening beforehand that is. The
		problem with this though is that with the average shower being only eight minutes long, there
		just isn’t enough time. I reckon you’d have to stand in the shower for a solid few hours which
		is tiring, bad for your skin and ain’t nobody got time for that.<br>

	<hr>
	<p>
		I’d love to hear your thoughts on this, especially if you know some stuff about how the body
		reacts to changes in temperature. Would you be willing to stand in a shower to find out the
		answer? Do you think this whole idea is just ridiculous? Let’s hear it.<br><br>

		title: "Upgrade Your Walls",

		readTime: "5 minutes",

		alt: "walls",
		content: `<p style="font-size: 1rem;">
		The year is 2014. I had just transitioned into high school and giant game company, Supercell’s
		<i><i>Clash of Clans</i></i> is gaining traction. Everyone is playing the game before school,
		after school and
		even during school. Clans are being formed. Wars are being held. Villages are being upgraded
		but, for some, upgrading walls is a non-necessity.<br><br>
		For some more context, <i><i>Clash of Clans</i></i> is an online strategy mobile game for
		Android and iOS
		developed by very successful game company Supercell. It was released in August 2012 for iOS and
		October 2013 for Android (iOS always gets nice things first smh). It is Supercell’s most
		successful game and one of the most successful games period. In 2018, it had generated more
		revenue than any app on the App Store ($6.4 billion dollars) since its launch and is still very
		popular today.<br><br>
		<i>Clash of Clans</i> revolves around a village that you’re the chief of. In order to progress
		in the
		game, you need to build and upgrade your defences and other buildings. But before you can do
		that, you need resources and you get those from attacking other villages using troops that you
		train and also upgrade over time. Others can attack your village too to steal your resources and
		you have to keep upgrading your defences to ensure that the least possible damage is done to
		your village when it’s attacked. Part of those defences are your walls.<br><br>
		Now here’s the thing with walls, they’re individual pieces that fit together to make any kind of
		shape you want. So when you’re upgrading them, you have to upgrade each individual wall, not to
		mention that walls aren’t cheap. This makes upgrading them a slow, painful, annoying and arduous
		process and as a result many people choose to neglect them, in favour of instead upgrading their
		defences. You then end up with some people who have really high-level villages but terrible
		walls, which is a really bad look in my opinion.<br><br>
		Upgrading your walls means that attackers will take longer to penetrate your village which in
		turn gives your defences more time to kill off the attacker’s troops. Cue the analogy. If you
		think about it, <i>Clash of Clans</i> is a lot like life. Your village is your life, your
		buildings are
		your skills and resources, your troops resemble your career, your defences are your beliefs and
		moral values and your walls, well your walls are what you use to prevent people with bad intent
		from breaking into your life. Walls are your guard and like <i>Clash of Clans</i>, one’s guard
		is often
		neglected and let down too easily which leaves one’s life compromised.<br><br>
		It’s easy to work on our skills, develop our careers and commit to our beliefs but we give a
		backseat to our guard and emotional wellbeing when they in fact should be driving the car. When
		we let our guard down, we become prone to attackers who will take advantage of the opening and
		steal whatever they can before moving on to the next target and at the end of the day you’re the
		one who’s affected. Everything else in your life stops to restore the damage that’s been done to
		not only your walls, but your whole village. Instead of developing your career, instead of
		improving your skills, you’re stuck doing repairs.<br><br>
	</p>

	<blockquote>Instead of developing your career, instead of improving your skills, you’re stuck doing
		repairs.
	</blockquote>

	<p>
		So, what then? The solution is simple really. Upgrade your walls! You shouldn’t let your guard
		down too easily and that means not rushing into anything before first doing your homework. After
		doing your homework, do some more homework and only lower that guard once you have absolute
		certainty (or 99% certainty at least) that the intent is right. Yeah sure it’s not fun, yeah
		sure it’s expensive and yeah sure they can still be broken down but even when they do get broken
		down, you would have had more time for your defences to fight the attacker off. Whether you play
		<i>Clash of Clans</i> or not, don’t forget to upgrade your walls.
	</p>

	<hr>
	<p>
		I hope you found my analogy of <i>Clash of Clans</i> to life interesting. If you agree, give the
		post a
		thumbs up. If you disagree let’s have a civil fight in the comments. Until next time, keep
		upgrading those walls. Oh and if you play <i>Clash of Clans</i>, I don’t wanna hear anything
		about air
		troops.<br><br>

	<p>
		So I’m gonna be running you through some of the tools I use to edit photos and videos both on my
		laptop as well as my phone. I’ve used these apps for my (very few) YouTube videos, birthday
		videos,
		logos and lots of other random things. Without further ado, let’s get into it.
	</p>
	<h2>Hitfilm Express</h2>

	<div class="post-image">
		<div>
			<img src=${"/assets/blog-images/hitfilm.PNG"} class="img" alt="Hitfilm Express">
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>
		Hitfilm Express is a free video editor for Windows and MacOS and I’m in love with it. It’s a
		very capable and powerful tool. I used it to edit the <i>Cycling Sites</i> video I forced you to
		watch
		and you can see how well that turned out (humble brag). It has plenty of great features, from a
		fully-fledged timeline, to motion tracking, key-framing and compositing. This might sound Greek
		to you, and you might think the learning curve is steep and you’d be right. But once you spend a
		few hours getting to grips with how it works, you can produce some truly beautiful
		videos.
	</p>

	<h2>Windows Video Editor</h2>

	<div class="post-image">
		<div>
			<img src=${"/assets/blog-images/windows_editor.PNG"} class="img" alt="Windows Video Editor">
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>
		One caveat of Hitfilm Express is that it’s pretty intense to run. For reference, I have a modest
		laptop setup (i5 6200U, 8GB RAM and an SSD for the techies) and I manage just about fine so if
		you
		have anything less than that, it might be slow and laggy. Enter Windows Video Editor. Windows
		has a built-in video editor that’s actually quite feature packed. It has a traditional timeline,
		tons of templates for text, and some cool effects. Of course it won’t be a match for Hitfilm but
		if you just want a quick, easy-to-use video editor for PC, this one is worth looking into.
	</p>

	<h2>InShot</h2>

	<div class="post-image">
		<div>
			<img src=${"/assets/blog-images/inshot.jpg"} class="img" alt="InShot">
		</div>
	</div>
	<p>
		Now on the mobile side of video editing. There are thousands of Android apps and I mean
		thousands but a good one that I’ve been using for ages is InShot. This is a simple, nifty app
		for doing quick edits. Adding text to the video, slowing a video down, adding music to a video.
		InShot is very versatile and best of all, it’s free!
	</p>

	<h2>GIMP</h2>

	<div class="post-image">
		<div>
			<img src=${"/assets/blog-images/GIMP.PNG"} class="img" alt="GIMP">
		</div>
	</div>
	<p>
		GIMP is popularly known as “the free Photoshop” and that’s actually an accurate description.
		GIMP is a very powerful open-source photo editor for Windows, Linux and MacOS. I use it for
		creating logos, posters, thumbnails (like the one for <i>Cycling Sites</i>) and anything that
		needs a
		bit more finesse than usual. It has lots of great features if you’re willing to sit down and
		learn about them. The learning curve is very steep, I don’t fully understand it myself, but the
		good thing is that there’s lots of support and plenty of great YouTube tutorials out there. So
		you’re sure to find someone who knows how to do what you want to do. (I also used it to
		remove the ads in the InShot and PicsArt screenshots.)
	</p>

	<h2>PicsArt</h2>

	<div class="post-image">
		<div>
			<img src=${"/assets/blog-images/picsart.jpg"} class="img" alt="PicsArt">
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>
		PicsArt is one of the best photo editors for mobile there is out there. It does a lot, here are a few:
	</p>
	<ul class="picsart-list">
		<li>Cropping</li>
		<li>Filters</li>
		<li>Drawing on top of other pictures</li>
		<li>Collages</li>
		<li>Borders and frames</li>
		<li>Square fitting</li>
		<li>Shape masks</li>
		<li>Text on pictures</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The point is, PicsArt can probably do ninety percent of the things you’d wanna do so it gets my
		vote.
	</p>

	<h2>Canva</h2>

	<div class="post-image">
		<div>
			<img src=${"/assets/blog-images/canva.PNG"} class="img" alt="Canva">
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>
		I’ll end it off with a website/app I talked about in <i>Cycling Sites</i>. Canva. This is a tool
		that’s
		great for making posters, flyers, adverts, presentations and even CVs. It’s very versatile and
		with thousands of templates to edit from, it’s very get up and running. You can even ditch the
		templates and create something beautiful from a blank slate. There’s even a mobile app for
		creating things on the go, definitely go check it out.
	</p>

	<h2>Honourable Mentions</h2>

	<p>
		For full on photo and video productions, there’s the Adobe Suite – Photoshop, Premiere Pro,
		Lightroom, After Effects - which is like Hitfilm Express and GIMP on steroids but you’ll have to pay
		a pretty penny for those. For MacOS users, iMovie is great for chopping together short quick
		videos without much effort and it’s free. Then for proper video production on MacOS there’s the
		popular Final Cut Pro but that’s also a paid app.
	</p>

		There’s a lot of great stuff out there that you can use to make beautiful things. Post your
		favourite tools in the comments and let’s share and discover new things. Catch you in the next

		I was thinking about how much to divulge in this blog to let you sufficiently in on my life, but
		also keep myself employable and then I remembered the <i>Iceberg Theory</i>. This theory alludes
		to how only a small part (about ten percent) of an iceberg is visible above water, with the rest
		hidden from view beneath the water. So let’s dive in.<br><br>
		Everyone calls me Tino, but my full name is Tinotenda Asher Muzambi. I’ve always been lowkey
		grateful that my parents gave me a name that shortens easily, but that’s also come with the
		caveat of nicknames being hard to come by. That hasn’t stopped some though. Throughout the years
		I’ve been called T, T-man, T-eye-know and Tintin just to name a few. I like to think of myself
		as a realist because optimism will let you down and pessimism will depress you, realism is a
		nice middle ground. It’s not half-full nor half-empty, it’s just a glass of water.<br><br>
		I’m a final year Computer Science student at the University of Cape Town (aka University of
		Constant Torture). I’ve always had a passion for all things computing from a young age and I’ve
		had the privilege of being able to follow my passion and I’m absolutely loving it. When I’m not
		busy with uni stuff, I’m almost always working on some personal project. If you’re interested,
		you can head over to my <a href="https://bit.ly/TinoGitHub"
								   target="_blank" style="color: skyblue">Github</a> to
		check some of them out.<br><br>
		It’s not all code in my world though. One must be a rounded individual and that means stepping
		away from the screens every now and again. For me, that primarily takes the form of cubing. If
		you’ve got no clue what I’m talking about, I’m talking about solving a 3x3x3 Rubik’s cube. I
		took up cubing in January of this year and after learning how to solve a cube, I became hooked.
		It’s just a very fascinating puzzle that keeps my Computer Science brain intrigued. If you do
		the Math, there are 43 quintillion possible combinations with a 3x3x3 cube. That’s 43 with 18
		zeroes after it! Let that sink in… Now that you’ve done that, I’m still relatively slow
		averaging 54 seconds with my record currently standing at 44.2 seconds. Once I go sub-thirty,
		I’ll drop a video on my <a href="https://bit.ly/TinoYouTube"
								   target="_blank" style="color: skyblue">channel</a>.<br><br>
		My other love is music. My Apple Music library recently surpassed 7000 songs, so the love is
		deeeeep. Christian Hip-Hop is my favourite genre and it makes up most of my songs. If you’ve
		never heard of the genre, here are some fire songs you’ve gotta hear:<br><br>

		I don’t only like listening to music though, I also love reproducing it and sometimes creating
		my own. And for that, I learnt how to play the piano. Playing an instrument is really an
		indescribable thing but I think spiritual is a good adjective. If you ever get a chance to learn
		one, take it.<br><br>
		There’s a lot more to me than the things above the surface, however. I believe that the answer
		to the question “Who are you?” doesn’t lie in your profession or your hobbies, but instead it
		goes much deeper. It’s in one’s beliefs, morals, fears, the thoughts that keeps one awake at
		night. But I’m not about to expose myself like that.<br><br>

		voicenote and that was my genuine reaction to it. Now I had to pause my fire music to listen to
		the voicenote.<br><br>
		That’s right, I hate voicenotes. Actually, hate is a strong word, let’s rather go for intense
		dislike shall we? I titled this blog <i>Why I Hate Voicenotes</i> as clickbait. Guilty as
		charged, I
		know. Oh and if I say hate, I mean intense dislike. With that disclaimer out of the way, let’s
		get to the meat of the blog.<br><br>
		I already mentioned the first point to explain my hate for voicenotes: I can’t listen to my
		music and voicenotes simultaneously. You need to understand something about me first – I’m
		<b>always</b> listening to music and all my music is fire, maybe I’ll go into that in my next
		blog. So
		you can imagine how frustrating it is constantly having to pause my fire music. Yes, I
		know apps like WhatsApp try combat this by lowering the volume of your music whilst the
		voicenote plays but it just doesn’t work. It’s a fact that we humans are terrible multitaskers.
		Propaganda in his spoken word piece, <a href="https://bit.ly/PropagandaBePresent"
												target="_blank" style="color: skyblue"><i>Be Present</i></a>
		(funny piece actually, defs recommend) sums it
		up perfectly when he says, “multitasking is a myth you ain’t doin’ anything good just everything
		awful.” I just can’t process everything the person who sent me a voicenote is saying whilst
		bumping Andy Mineo in the background which means I have to pause my music just to listen to what
		you have to say which gets exhausting.<br><br></p>

	<blockquote>multitasking is a myth you ain’t doin’ anything good just everything
		awful.
	</blockquote>

		You may or may not know this but if you start playing a voicenote through your phone’s speakers,
		you can hold it up to your ear and it’ll continue playing through your phone’s earpiece. Useful
		life hack for when you don’t have earphones and need to listen to a voicenote in public. A small
		but annoying caveat with this is that since phones use the proximity sensor to achieve this, if
		my phone is lying flat on my table and I start playing a voicenote and I accidentally
		momentarily cover the proximity sensor, the voicenote stops playing and now I have to press play
		again. Small I know, but it really annoys me.<br><br>
		Another thing that frustrates me is people who don’t understand voicenote etiquette. We’ve all
		received those voicenotes where the person starts talking before it starts recording and those
		who stop recording before they’re done talking. Maybe you’re one of those people but I’m not
		here to point fingers. Then there’s a different subset of people that for some or other reason
		send inaudible voicenotes. Imagine now I’ve paused my music and now I have to turn up the volume
		so I can hear your barely audible voicenote then get scared off my chair when I resume the music
		forgetting to reduce the volume. EP right?<br><br>
		This one applies specifically to longer voicenotes but in general, voicenotes are much harder to
		consume. I have to now keep track of everything you’re saying in my mind so I can address
		everything you’re telling me and that’s a lot of work. Unlike with text where I can see the
		points you mentioned and address them easily. And that’s a good segue to a benefit that
		text provides that voicenotes don’t – text is searchable! That means if you start wyling
		making contradictory statements, I can search up the history and call you out. But if you were
		wyling in a voicenote, calling you out becomes much harder.<br><br>
		I think the sweet spot for sending a voicenote is 30 < x < 120 where x is a variable of time
		measured in seconds. Anything less than 30, type. Anything greater than 120, call. You can fight
		me in the comments. But jokes aside, voicenotes are grossly abused on social media and though I
		understand that there are genuine cases where sending a voicenote instead of typing is
		warranted, more often than not, they’re just used because someone is lazy to type. When they’re
		used right, voicenotes are great and I myself use them everyday in fact and their inclusion in
		social networks is a great feature.<br><br>
		Oh, and to be honest, sometimes I’ll avoid replying to you just because you sent me a voicenote
		because I won’t be in the mood for voicenotes at that moment in time. So if you sent me a
		voicenote and it seems like I’m now ignoring you, I am.<br><br>
		If nobody sends me voicenotes after this, I’ll know I’ve done a good job.<br><br>

		If you’ve read this far, thank you so much for reading my rant on voicenotes. Lemme know your
		thoughts. How do you feel about voicenotes? Am I being dramatic? Do you relate to people who
		don’t have voicenote etiquette? Are you the one who doesn’t have voicenote etiquette? I’d love
		to engage and stay tuned to blog.tinomuzambi.com for more blogs coming soon.<br><br>
